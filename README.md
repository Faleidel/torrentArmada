Todo:

- add a way to save a board
- add a way to archive old messages
- add a board directory?
    - That would mean each server needs to also be a client of my board directory
- sort threads and comment by a mix of # of childrens and date
- add support for markdown
- add support for images from torrents with upload in the app via webtorrents
