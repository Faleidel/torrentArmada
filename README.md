Todo:

- add a client counter on the server
    - add this info on the clients with the update infos msg
- sort threads and comment by a mix of # of childrens and date
- add a way to archive old messages
- add a board directory?
    - That would mean each server needs to also be a client of my board directory
    - Need to test that it does not cause a problem to open a connection to an other server as a server
